# Rabbit Fox Island

Semester Project for COSC 40703: High Performance and Parallel Computing

## Description

Once upon a time there was an island populated only by rabbits, foxes, and vegetation. The island (conveniently enough) was the exact shape of a chessboard. Some local geographers have even drawn gridlines the serve to divide the island into 64 squares to facilitate their demographic studies on the populations of each inhabitant.
